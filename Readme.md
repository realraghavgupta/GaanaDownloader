A Java tool to download and convert songs to MP3 from Gaana in Bulk

## Gaana:

[Gaana](http://gaana.com/) is a music streaming free service. There are also mobile Apps that allow users to listen to music for free in their mobiles. 

The mobile App features unlimited download of songs for a small amount of fee. The catch here is that the downloaded songs can be listed through the Gaana App only. 

Using this utility, songs can be downloaded in bulk and converted to audio files with proper tags
Also there is an option to organise the songs into folders named under their Album names
